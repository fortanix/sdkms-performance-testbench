# SDKMS Rest Performance Test Bench
---

# Overview
Performance test bench for SDKMS using REST API interface. It generates reports in HTML and CSV format. SDKMS REST performance test bench dynamically generates the JMeter JMX file and provides configurable way to specify thread count and time duration to run the operation.

**Note:** Added support for SDKMS JCE provider as the client for operations, in 0.2.0 version. For more information on JCE provider, visit [Support Site](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018362951-JCE)

Performance Test Bench has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 server.

# Prerequisites
* [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Manual environment setup
* Following environment variables need to be set:

	 `FORTANIX_API_KEY=<Fortanix SDKMS API KEY>`

	 [Optional] `FORTANIX_API_ENDPOINT=<SDKMS URL>`

	 [Optional] `SDKMS_SSL_TRUST_STORE`=<Path to SSL Trust Store>

	Example:

		export FORTANIX_API_KEY="OS00ZDQN2U...............aWdZVnp4UVBSX2JSWE"
		export FORTANIX_API_ENDPOINT="https://sdkms.fortanix.com"

	> FORTANIX\_API\_ENDPOINT is optional and default to https://apps.sdkms.fortanix.com .
 	> SDKMS\_SSL\_TRUST_STORE is needed only for on-premises deployments.

## Automatic environment setup

> All above operation run by default with 50 thread for 5 minutes. All above operation support --threadcount and --time to overwrite the default thread count and duration.

> Key generated during operation get deleted at the end of operation.

# Report Location
Let's assume we have cloned the repo at /opt/rest-api.

- HTML

	`/opt/rest-api/target/jmeter/reports/`

- CSV

	`/opt/rest-api/target/jmeter/results/`
	
# Adding File Identifiers
Sometimes when running multiple sequential test cases that are similar in nature, it is possible that the output report files may get overwritten when the tool saves them with the same name. To avoid this, we can add a file identifier with the 'file-idf' parameter (optional) to distinguish them from one another:

	Example:
		# test-bench.sh run plugin --pluginId <plugin-id> --pluginType <plugin-type> --threadcount 10 --time 120 --file-idf encryptPluginResult
		# test-bench.sh run plugin --pluginId <plugin-id> --pluginType <plugin-type> --threadcount 10 --time 120 --file-idf decryptPluginResult

# Sample Output
operation | threads | duration(sec) | total operations | average latency(ms) | p90 latency(ms) | p99 latency(ms) | min latency (ms) | max latency (ms) | Error % | Throughput per sec | capacity (kb/s)
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
SDKMS Signature Generation | 1 | 300 | 16020 | 13 | 21 | 26 | 6 | 154 | 0.00% | 53.4 | NA

* capacity columns is only supported for AES Encryption/Decryption with provided filepath.

# Connection Pooling
With JCE Connection Pooling

The environment variable FORTANIX_CONN_MAX is set to the maximum number of connections from that instance of the JCE application.

When the environment variable FORTANIX_CONN_MAX is not exported or is set to `0`, JCE will behave without any connection pooling/limit
